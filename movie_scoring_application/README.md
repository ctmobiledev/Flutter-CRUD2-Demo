# movie_scoring_application

A Flutter project demonstrating CRUD capabilities (create, read, update, delete) as well as use of the Realm 
ORM database.

This is a bare-bones project that could serve as a basis for any database app. In its current state, it would
be suitable for a small project, but could be adjusted for larger works with the addition of an architectural
pattern.
